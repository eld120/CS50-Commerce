Ever revist a homework assignment thats over a year old?

## Abey?
Taking inspiration from the largest auction website that I know of, this app is goes a bit beyond what was required when I first dove into django in 2020.

### Current objectives:
- establish a mobile first responsive UI (not started)
- establish a CI/CD pipeline using Github Actions (not started)
- maintain PEP8 coding standards using pre-commit (done)
- achieve and maintain 100% unit test coverage for all of my code (in progress)
- learn Pytest best practices (in progress)
