# CS50w Commerce
Revisiting my first [django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/) app. This project does not aim to reproduce all of ebay's functionality but does intend to generally allow any user to view content and for authenticated users to create or interact with auctions.

### Challenges
- Moving logic from views to models in an effort to reuse code functionality.
- Minimizing SQL queries and caching
- Implementing Celery (an async task queue)

### Current objectives:
- mobile first responsive UI
- CI/CD pipeline using Github Actions (not started)
- Code style enforced with pre-commit
- maximize unit test coverage with coverage and pytest
- improve code reuse/readability
- documentation with sphinx (not started)


## Getting started
